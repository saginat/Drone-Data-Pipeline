# Introduction
Welcome to the Drone Data Processing project repository! This project focuses on the collection, processing, and structuring of raw data captured by a drone. The processed and labeled data can be used for various machine learning research purposes, such as object detection, image classification, and more.

# Project Overview
Drones have become an essential tool for collecting data in various domains, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. However, raw drone data can be challenging to work with directly. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a comprehensive pipeline for processing raw drone data.

The key steps in this project include data collection, data processing, and data structuring. We've also included statistical techniques and checks to ensure the quality of the data. The resulting structured and labeled dataset can serve as a valuable resource for machine learning researchers and practitioners.

# Data Collection
The data used in this project was collected using a drone equipped with various sensors and cameras. The drone was flown over the target area, and data was collected over multiple flights. The raw data includes images, sensor readings.

# Data Processing
To make the raw data suitable for machine learning research, we've performed several data processing tasks:

# Data Cleaning: We've cleaned the raw data to remove any noise or outliers.

# Image Preprocessing: Images collected by the drone were preprocessed to enhance their quality and remove artifacts.

# Labeling: For supervised learning tasks, we've labeled the data by identifying and annotating samples in a given flight.

# Structuring: The data is structured into a well-organized format, making it easy to access and use in various machine learning frameworks.

# Statistical Analysis: We've applied statistical techniques to validate the data's consistency and quality.
